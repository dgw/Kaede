# About
Kaede is an IRC bot. If you're in a channel with Kaede and you request a new feature or report a bug,
if your suggestion doesn't fit into the issue tracker for a module or component of the bot, it should
go in this repository's issue tracker.

Feel free to make suggestions. I've no shortage of things to tweak when I sit down to do a little coding,
but the list is already growing faster than I have time to deal with. You need only look at my
plan-to-watch/read/play lists for anime, movies, TV shows, books, and games to see that I'm addicted to
lists of things that I would like to do. Toss a few more at me!
